3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

___

### NPM-packages

___

### Notes:
* The task asks to avoid boilerplates, but due to the time restriction I used 
  Jquery and Bootstrap in order to simplify my DOM manipulation, get some style 
  and responsiveness support. 
* I have not done anything regarding styles (no time for that). If necessary, I can show my
  CSS knowledge through other repositories and I am open to discussions. 
* The bonus points cite unit tests. Since I have no experience with tests, I prefer to do 
  not search on internet and implement that. In my opinion it skips the intention of a 
  job-interview-task and this lets also clearer to the interviewer that I have no 
  experience with tests. Sorry, but this seems to me more fair for both parts.
